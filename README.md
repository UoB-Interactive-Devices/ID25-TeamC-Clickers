## Manifesto

The digital pet :
- can understand what you want through your interaction and can give a helpful/entertaining/comforting response
- is something that seems a bit alive/ animal like
- creates a emotional attachment to it (ie because it's cute)
- won't do something that could negatively impact you on purpose
- can come with you/portable and is smaller than you

## Overleaf

[Interactive Devices - Little Chef](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jrgjjcbtjtsd#6c3bbd)

## Intial Ideas

 1.	Little Chef:
- Helps people who don’t like cooking/ aren’t use to it
- Tells you recipes
- Sets timers if needed
- Check what steps you have done and tells you when to do next step
-	Has a bowl which weighs the food
-	Tell me a fact while you cook setting
-	Can do voice activated or press its head

2.	Grow-U
-	Pet grows when you do enough steps/ do your workout
-	Grows when you get enough sleep
-	Study
-	water

## Designs

## Writing

Abstract and Intro (clarity) (10)
- Currently written and in overleaf
- Need to add results after carrying out the study
 
Related work/orginality (15)
- Thermomix
- Checkout - cooking robot, cooking with conversion (prompt recipe assistant bot)
- Originality - no device that currently teaches you in real time

Design and implementation  (total 40)
- Outline method and steps 
- theory, assembly, materials, ideas etc. 
- Different iteration our design went through and why changes were made
-   From animal to robot (robot seems cleaner and is easier to build)
-   Made Robot larger and less thick (screen wouldn't fit and was unecessarily bulky)

Device evaluation (study) (10) 
- Does the device meet its requirement of making cooking easier and helping the individual learn 
- What is specific feature of the device that worked well 
- How could this device be improved 

Discussion (5) 
- What the possibility (in mainstream) of having a device like this mean
